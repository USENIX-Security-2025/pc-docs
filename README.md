## Calendar

You can download `USENIX_Security_25_PC_calendar.ics` and import it into your favorite calendar app. We tested the ICS file on:
* Google Calendar: Visit calendar.google.com, go to Settings > Import & Export > Select file from your computer > Import
* Apple Calendar/Microsoft Outlook: Drag and drop the ICS file into the calendar app

Alternatively, you can import the calendar by using the GitHub link to the raw file ([this one](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USENIX-Security-2025/pc-docs/main/USENIX_Security_25_PC_calendar.ics)):
* Google Calendar: Settings > Add calendar > From URL > Paste the URL in the "URL of the calendar" field
